# Traffic_sign_classifier
Using deep neural nets to classify German traffic datatset.
## Project Summary
In this project I have used Deep Learning to train my model to be able to correctly identify images of German Traffic Signs. I then 
tested my model on new images taken from the internet and images of traffic signs that i clicked in Mumbai.

  
  
This barchart shows how the data is classified in  different classes

**Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Project**

The steps of this project are the following:
* Load the data set (see below for links to the project data set)
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report
